### App Installation ###

- npm install or npm install --legacy-peer-deps

### Remarks about the challenge ###

- I was able to complete the following pages
  - PLP (product list page i.e ProductListScreen.tsx)
  - PDP (product detail page i.e ProductDetailsScreen.tsx)
  - Cart (CartScreen.tsx)
- The project has language translation support implemented using i18next
- The screens are responsive
- I have used Mob X for state management 

I had so much fun while doing the project at 10x my normal speed ðŸ˜„ but nonetheless it was a good experience !
So far I only encountered one logical bug in one screen (CartScreen.tsx) that i would debug together with the team!

Thank You !
